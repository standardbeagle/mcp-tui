# Master Request Analysis: MCP-TUI v0.6.0

## Original Request
**User Request**: "get this to 0.6.0 use code search for analysis and make sure prompt and resource results are viewable and all messages from the mcps are visible, long running task progress bars should be active and spinners for all mcp tool calls even if they don't report progress"

## Business Context
**Why This Feature is Needed**: MCP-TUI currently focuses heavily on tools but lacks comprehensive support for prompts and resources - two core MCP protocol features. Users need full visibility into MCP server capabilities and communication for effective debugging and development.

**Success Definition**: 
- All MCP prompts are discoverable and executable with results properly displayed
- All MCP resources are browsable and readable with content viewing
- All MCP protocol messages are visible for debugging and transparency
- All operations show appropriate progress indicators for better UX
- Version 0.6.0 tagged with comprehensive MCP protocol support

**Project Phase**: Production enhancement - building on stable v0.5.0 foundation
**Timeline Constraints**: No explicit deadlines, focus on quality implementation
**Integration Scope**: Core MCP service layer, TUI screens, CLI commands, progress components

## Critical Assumptions Identification

**Technical Assumptions**:
- MCP Go SDK supports prompts/resources (✅ VERIFIED - service.go has ListPrompts, GetPrompt, ListResources)
- Current UI architecture can accommodate new content types
- Progress components exist and can be enhanced (✅ VERIFIED - progress.go, spinner.go exist)
- Debug logging framework supports MCP message visibility (✅ VERIFIED - debug logging exists)

**Business Assumptions**:
- Users need prompt/resource functionality as much as tools
- Progress indicators will significantly improve user experience
- MCP message visibility is valuable for debugging
- Current user base will benefit from these enhancements

**Architecture Assumptions**:
- Three-tab system (tools/resources/prompts) can be expanded
- Current service interface can handle new operations
- TUI framework supports additional content display modes
- CLI can be extended with new commands

**Resource Assumptions**:
- Implementation complexity is moderate (not requiring architectural changes)
- Can leverage existing patterns from tool implementation
- Progress indicators can reuse existing component framework

**Integration Assumptions**:
- No breaking changes to existing tool functionality
- New features integrate cleanly with current debug system
- Progress indicators work across all transport types (stdio, HTTP, SSE)

## Assumption Risk Assessment

**High-Risk Assumptions**:
- Progress indicators work reliably across all MCP operations and transport types
- Resource content can be displayed effectively in TUI without performance issues
- Prompt argument collection works smoothly within TUI constraints

**Medium-Risk Assumptions**:
- Current tab navigation system scales well to 4+ tabs
- MCP message logging doesn't impact performance significantly
- Resource/prompt result formatting handles various content types

**Low-Risk Assumptions**:
- Basic CRUD operations for prompts/resources work
- Existing patterns can be adapted for new content types
- CLI extension follows established patterns
